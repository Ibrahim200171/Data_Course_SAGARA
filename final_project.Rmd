Introduction
This project explores how GRE, GPA, and undergraduate school rank influence the probability of being admitted to graduate school. The main question is: Does undergraduate rank affect admissions even after controlling for GPA and GRE?

Data Loading
Writing

grad <- read_csv("Data/GradSchool_Admissions.csv") %>%
mutate(
admit = factor(admit, levels=c(0,1), labels=c("Rejected","Admitted")),
rank = factor(rank, levels=1:4, labels=paste("Rank",1:4))
)
summary(grad)

Exploratory Plots
Admission Rate by Rank
Writing

grad %>%
group_by(rank) %>%
summarize(admit_rate = mean(admit=="Admitted")) %>%
ggplot(aes(rank, admit_rate)) +
geom_col(fill="#2c7fb8") +
scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +
labs(title="Admission Rate by Undergrad Rank", y="Admission Rate")

GRE by Admission Status
Writing

ggplot(grad, aes(admit, gre, fill=admit)) +
geom_boxplot() +
theme(legend.position="none") +
labs(title="GRE Scores by Admission Status", y="GRE Score")

GPA by Admission Status
Writing

ggplot(grad, aes(admit, gpa, fill=admit)) +
geom_boxplot() +
theme(legend.position="none") +
labs(title="GPA by Admission Status", y="GPA")

Logistic Regression Model
Writing

fit <- glm(admit ~ gre + gpa + rank, data=grad, family="binomial")
fit %>% tbl_regression(exponentiate=TRUE) %>% bold_labels()

Marginal Effects (New Skill)
Writing

pred <- ggpredict(fit, terms=c("gre [200:800 by=50]", "rank"))
plot(pred) + labs(title="Predicted Probability of Admission", x="GRE", y="Probability")

Conclusions
Undergraduate rank strongly affects admission probability even after adjusting for GRE and GPA.

Higher GRE and GPA increase the odds of admission.

Students from lower-ranked schools face a disadvantage independent of academic metrics.

Future work could include fairness metrics, random forest modeling, or additional predictors.
